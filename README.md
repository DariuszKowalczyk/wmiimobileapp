#WMiI Mobile App

## Working with source control
1. Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/cmorawski96/wmiimobileapp.git`)
2. Make appropriate changes
3. Check affected files with `git status`
4. **Make sure** that changes are correct by looking at `git diff`'s output
5. Add modified files (usually just `git add .` in order to add all files)
6. Make a commit (use `git commit -m "Commit description"` - remember about the `-m` parameter as long as you don't like vim)
7. Push a commit to the remote repository (means this one) using `git push origin master`
8. To pull changes from other collaborators use `git pull origin master`
9. In case of *merge conflict*, email sobak[at]sobak.pl or pray to God
10. Feel free to use this readme to help your collaborators at their projects
